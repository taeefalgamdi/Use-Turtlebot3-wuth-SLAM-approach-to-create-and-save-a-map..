Install TurtleBot3 Packages
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-dynamixel-sdk $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot3-msgs $ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-turtlebot3

Enter these codes in the terminal to install Simulation packages
||Simulation Install 6. 1. 1.

$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ $ git clone -b melodic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git $ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make

Make sure to Type "$ cd" or make a new terminal after the 3rd step

After you are done type in this command in the terminal

$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash 6.In a new terminal Run these commands in the terminal to launch the simulation world.

Launch Simulation World
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch

7.In a new terminal Run these commands in the terminal to launch the SLAM Node.

"Run SLAM Node"
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger $ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping to run the SLAM Node and see the generated map by the Robot.

8.In a new terminal Run this command to be able to interact and control the robot

Run Teleoperation Node
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger $ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch After you run the 2 codes Now you should be able to control the robot using the keys WASDX to roam around the gazebo simulated map.

After you are done exploring the map with your robot you should save the map using (Ctrl + Alt + T).
